# blackscholes
Options price calculator based on the Black-Scholes model. Not finished just yet. 

Will be implementing the all of the other options calculations over the next few days. American vs European, calls, puts, all of the Greeks, as well as additional calculations that are useful for gaining insight about past, current, and future markets.

GUI support will be coming as well.
